With this app, you can:

* Visualize cancer rates across different BC Geographies with choropleth maps using [tmap](https://github.com/mtennekes/tmap)
* Test for spatial autocorrelation using Global and Local Moran's tests using [sf](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf) and [spdep](https://github.com/r-spatial/spdep).

**Please Note**

This app uses **FAKE DATA** and is still **under development**.

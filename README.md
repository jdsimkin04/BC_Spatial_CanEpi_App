With this [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) app, you can:

* Visualize age-standardized cancer incidence rates across different BC Geographies with choropleth maps using [tmap](https://github.com/mtennekes/tmap)
  + BC health administrative boundary files provided by [BC Gov Data Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset?download_audience=Public)
* Explore and download data with [DT](https://github.com/rstudio/DT) Datable
* Test for spatial autocorrelation using Global and Local Moran's tests using [sf](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf) and [spdep](https://github.com/r-spatial/spdep)

App lives [here](https://jdsimkin04.shinyapps.io/bc_spatial_canepi_app/).
